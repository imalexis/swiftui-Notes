/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 keyboard actions.
 
 KeyboardKit will registers a `StandardKeyboardActionHandler`
 in the input view controller's `context` when the extension
 is started. You can replace the standard one by registering
 a new `actionHandler` in this context.
 
 `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` has a LOT of built-in logic
 that can also be overridden. If you want to create a custom
 action handler, you should probably subclass it and replace
 the parts you want to customize.
