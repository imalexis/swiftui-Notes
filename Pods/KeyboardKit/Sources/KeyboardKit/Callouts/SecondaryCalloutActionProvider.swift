/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 a set of secondary input characters for any keyboard action.
 
 KeyboardKit registers a standard protocol implementation in
 the keyboard context when the extension is started. You can
 replace this at any time, by applying a new instance to the
 context's `secondaryCalloutActionProvider` property.
 
 `IMPORTANT` This is an experimental new feature, that could
 be redesigned in any minor release until 4.0.
