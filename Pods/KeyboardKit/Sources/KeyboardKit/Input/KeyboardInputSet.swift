/**
 A "keyboard input set" represents the text input parts of a
 system keyboard, i.e. the lighter input keys.
 
 Some devices may add additional inputs to an input set. For
 instance, iPad devices adds punctionation and characters to
 the bottom rows. These inputs are not considered to be part
 of the input set, but rater the full keyboard layout.
 
 To implement a system keyboard, you need a `KeyboardLayout`
 instead of just an input set, since a layout also specifies
 the actions that surround the input set characters.
