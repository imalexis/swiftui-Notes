## About KeyboardKitSwiftUI

`KeyboardKitSwiftUI` extends [KeyboardKit][KeyboardKit] with SwiftUI support.  It's temporarily a separate project, since SwiftUI requires iOS 13 and KeyboardKit targets iOS 11.

SwiftUI support is currently an `experimental feature`, where I work on finding a good fit with the main library. To be able to move swiftly (pun intended) and not get stuck with a bunch of deprecations and migrations, I will allow breaking changes between minor versions.

This library will become a part of the main library in v `4.0`, and will then completely replace UIKit, which will no longer be supported. [Read more about this decision here.][Post]
